# File Name: main.py
# Description: Entry point for processing test images. Processes all images in the ../data/test directory using the preprocessing pipeline.
# Notes: N/A
# Flow: This file is executed first whenever a user attempts to run a test on a new mammogram image. The input is typically an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format. Once the file is provided, it is passed on for pre-processing. Essentially, this file initiates the user experience, allowing the user to try out the outcome of the testing workflow.
